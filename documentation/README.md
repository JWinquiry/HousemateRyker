üè° Housemate Ryker: The GuysNextDoor Community Manager
Housemate Ryker is a custom-built Discord bot designed for the GuysNextDoor community. Its primary function is to automate moderation, drive member engagement, and provide a stable, feature-rich environment.

This bot is engineered for 24/7 uptime using a Web Service hosting model to prevent the "sleeping bot" issues common on free hosting platforms.

‚ú® Core Features (Vibe Economy 2.0)
Housemate Ryker now runs a complete, persistent economy with user customization and strong moderation tools:
