# ðŸ”’ Privacy Policy

This policy details how your data is collected and managed by our custom system, **Housemate Ryker**, ensuring transparency and security.

### 2.1 Data Collection and Storage

Our custom bot, **Housemate Ryker**, collects and stores the following non-personal data for community management purposes:

* **Discord User ID:** This numerical ID is the minimum required data to uniquely identify you for rank tracking.

* **Vibe (XP) Points:** Tracks your activity level for the "Moving Up The Block" leveling system.

* **Last Message Timestamp:** Records the last time you earned Vibe to enforce the **15-second cooldown** and prevent spam.

### 2.2 Data Usage

The collected data is used exclusively within this server to:

* Manage the Vibe (XP) and leveling system.

* Automate the assignment and removal of cosmetic "Neighborhood Rank" roles.

* Display leaderboards (`!leaderboard`) and individual rank status (`!rank`).

### 2.3 Message Content

**Housemate Ryker** does **not** permanently store the content of your messages. It only processes messages to count them for Vibe rewards and to check for command prefixes (e.g., `!rank`).

### 2.4 Data Retention and Removal

* **Retention:** Data (User ID, Vibe, Timestamp) is retained while you are a member of the server to ensure rank continuity.

* **Removal:** Upon leaving the server, your collected Vibe data will be marked for eventual deletion. If you wish to have your data permanently and immediately deleted from our database, please contact an administrator.

### 2.5 Data Sharing

We do not share your User ID, Vibe data, or any other collected information with any external third parties, including advertisers or other Discord servers.
